# Neural machine translation chatbot

Applying neural machine translation for the purposes of creating an artificial conversational entity. 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility and implement methods of creating
artificial conversational entities, or chatterbots using a novel new sequence-to-sequence techniques derived 
from advancements in machine learning, specifically in the fields of natural language processing and 
neural machine translation (NMT).

An NMT will be trained on a dataset of comments from Reddit provided by Jason? i think, from (https://files.pushshift.io/reddit/comments/)[this link]

# Functional Description

## 1. Database creation
Taking the data out of the original json file, preprocess it and place it into a database for easier use.
